# Cypress Project XHR testing

This is a project which I have done to learn Cypress testing framework. The goal of the project was to test XHRs using [Cypress example site](https://example.cypress.io/commands/network-requests).Tests are written using Cypress version 13.6.3. Main browser used for running tests was Google Chrome version 121. Tests also work on Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers.

You can install all of the dependencies using command in the terminal **npm install**. To run the Cypress, just use the command **npx cypress open** in the terminal.
